	      Do you want to write a kernel module? Want to get into kernel
	      programming but don't know where to start? Feel intimidated by
	      millions of lines of impenetrable kernel code or frustrated
	      by out of date documentation with examples that won't even
	      compile? If so, then this book is for you.
	    </p>

	      <span id="title">The Linux Kernel Module Programmers Guide</span>
	      introduces you to the basics of how to write a module, from
	      <i>"hello world"</i> to scheduling and elementary driver
	      development. This isn't a deep dive into Linux's subsystems but
	      does give you a starting point from which you can continue on
	      your adventures. Each section provides runnable examples so
	      that you can get hands-on experience of how the kernel works.
